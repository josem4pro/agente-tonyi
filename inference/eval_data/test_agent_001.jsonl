{"question": "I have a Python FastAPI application that needs to handle WebSocket connections for real-time updates, but I'm also running CPU-intensive background tasks (data processing with pandas). The background tasks are blocking my WebSocket connections, causing timeouts and dropped connections. What is the correct architectural solution to run CPU-bound tasks without blocking the async event loop in FastAPI? Give me the specific approach, the key code pattern, and any libraries I need to install.", "answer": "reference"}
